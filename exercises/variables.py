# ------------ PYTHON VARIABLES ------------
# ------------------------------------------

# define a valid variable in python, then print() it out


# define three variables that are *not allowed* by the naming conventions


# try defining a variable called 'try' - why does it not work?


# check all reseved keywords that can't be used as var names


Var = 1  # this throws no error - why not? why not use it?


# define two variables in one line


# when is this useful? why should it be otherwise avoided?


# reassign a variable - assign 'hello' to a different value


# use input() to ask for user input - - assign it to a variable
