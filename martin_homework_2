# ------------ PYTHON VARIABLES ------------
# ------------------------------------------

# define a valid variable in python, then print() it out

a = "Hello!"
print(a)

try = "Hello"
#Answer: Because try is a Python "keyword"

# check all reseved keywords that can't be used as var names
#Checked! 

# define two variables in one line
a = "Hello"; b = "Goodbye" 

# when is this useful? why should it be otherwise avoided?
# Answer: I'm not sure that it is useful. I think it should be avoided
# because it's potentially confusing, especially if variables are of different types
# I think it's good practice to assign one variable per line with an explanatory
# note as to its role.


# reassign a variable - assign 'hello' to a different value
a = "hello"
b = "hello"


# use input() to ask for user input - - assign it to a variable
# Input statement to ask user for favorite type of dog
height = input ("How tall are you, in inches?")
height = int(height)

if height >= 36:
	print("You are tall enought to ride!")
else:
	print("I'm sorry, you cannot ride...but there may be a role for you in Game of Throwns!")
